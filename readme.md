Current plan for the application is to give an overview of which regions have had fires in the past and the amount on a glance. The areas are clickable and when clicked will provide a popup showing the average stats,?highest/lowest recorded?, and the table used to find those stats. This will make the statistics from the CSV easier to compare on a glance but will not provide any insightfull
